# ChatroomServer
The backend of the ChatroomApp.

The Project can be connected with the ChatroomApp and creates a simple Chatroom where anyone can join and chat.

This is a WebSocketServer Application which can be accessed via ["ws://localhost:8080"].

It'll create a bidirectional connection between client and server. Each client will receive messages which were sent from clients.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command will start the server.
